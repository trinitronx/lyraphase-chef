# TODO: Craft something like my sprout-wrap bootstrap script, but without soloist, and ChefDK instead?
#       Rely on `knife bootstrap` default Omnibus instead?  Not sure which is best, but current hosts have ChefDK already
#       and have already been bootstrapped with soloist, so this script is empty & moot for now
